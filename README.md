Nuxt.js was used in building the frontend of this web application and PHP/mySQL for the backend/database.


## About
There is a popular saying that _"Health is Wealth"_.

Our society right now is faced with the challenge of dealing with fake drugs which have taken over our markets and even going to the extent of claiming innocent lives.
We saw this as a problem to our society and decided to rise to the challenges to limit its destruction to lives.

We decided to provide a solution to this challenge which is in line with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 3: Good Health and Well-being i.e. Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages are essential to sustainable development**.
We arrived at a solution by developing this App and named it "DV App" (Drug Verification app).

We designed and built this app for everyone in Nigeria to be able to verify their drugs upon purchase from any drug vendor, if the drugs they are about to consume is void of harm and if it is fully endorsed by the National Agency of Foods and Drugs Administration Company (NAFDAC) which is concerned with the regularization of consumables.

## Our Vision

We believe that this App will go a long way in helping save lives and also put to check the number of fake drugs that are being put out by so many people who have no regard for human lives and try to enrich themselves at the expense of innocent lives.

## Why

This App provides a solution that addresses the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, with focus on avoiding usage of harmful drugs.


## Usage
To make use of the Drug Verification app, Please wait until more info is released.
